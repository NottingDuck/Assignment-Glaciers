# Assignment-Glaciers

This assignment asks you to write some code for loading and analysing a real dataset about glaciers around the world. We will describe how the code must behave, but it is up to you to fill in the implementation.
Besides this, you will also need to create some tests, and demonstrate your ability to use git version control and GitHub.
